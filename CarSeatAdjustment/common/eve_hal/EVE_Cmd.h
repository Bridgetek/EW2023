 * @file EVE_Cmd.h
 * @brief EVE's command read/write
 
 * This file defines the generic APIs of phost access layer for the FT800 or EVE compatible silicon.
 * Application shall access FT800 or EVE resources over these APIs,regardless of I2C or SPI protocol.
 * In addition, there are some helper functions defined for FT800 coprocessor engine as well as phost commands.
